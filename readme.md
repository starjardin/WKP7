# WKP7 Report.

## Structure of my code.
First of all the project was not fullfiled, however, some of the steps were achived. I did create an array of obects (collection) to store the existing books at the first time the page is reloaded. Secondly, I created html file which contains the form fieled in which we add new books, and a void table element in where we place the books, after that, I grabed some elements that I thought would be useful and added event listener to the form element. I created a function that generates the existing books and a function that generate the new books form the users. I could delete but it is a bit strange because when we refresh and it adds a lot of books.After all, I did not get round to doing the checkbox.

## Improve I would make if I had more time.
If I had more time, first I would probably fixe the problem that causes me trouble when I reload the page. Then, I would work on the checkbox, to tackle these steps might help, grab the checkboxes, loop through the array and check if the object proerty read if true or false and set the value of the checkbox (just a generale idea). Lastly, cleaning up the code by adding lots of comments to the code as much as it should be to make it a lot more understandble.

## Did I learn anything.

Oh, yes indeed I did learn something such as I know how the delete buttons work by using filter. I did understand why we use `custom event` even though it is still baffles me so far. Sending data to local storage and geting them back (`setItem`, `getItem`, JSON.stringify and JSON.parse).

## The most challanging part.

Most of it was challenging, however, it was fun to make it but if I had to say a thing I would probably say that the most challenging part was to store data to local storage as well as the `Custom event is still a bit obscure to me`. After reloading the page.

## Explanations about specific parts
I would absolutely say, I need explanations about the `custom event` updatiing `custom event`, and parameteres given to functions. Why we do need state sometimes but not using the first original array.

## Comments
I don't have a lot to say but it's all about the challenge if you love challanges, it looks amazing when the problem is solved.
